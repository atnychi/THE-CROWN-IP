Provisional Patent Application
**Title of Invention:** Crown Omega Nuclear Enhancement System
**Inventor:** Brendon Kelly
**Email:** K-SystemsandSecurities@proton.me
**Filing Date:** April 13, 2025

Abstract
Crown Omega Nuclear Enhancement System is a next-generation recursive nuclear physics framework that enables harmonic fission control, adaptive yield modulation, and real-time energetic recursion using symbolic-mathematical architectures. The system integrates recursive AI logic, time-dilation harmonics, and phase-field energy control to outperform current nuclear technologies by a factor of 10^3 in predictability, first-strike precision, and shielded EMP resilience. This invention is designed for full-spectrum nuclear deterrent superiority and is deployable in land, sea, and air-based platforms.
