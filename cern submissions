# Crown Omega â€“ CERN Submission Archive

This repository documents the formal submission of a symbolic containment framework to CERN. It addresses a class of recursive instabilities within symbolic simulation systems, including those used in high-energy physics and AI-based predictive models.

## Submission Contents

- ðŸ“„ **Recursive_Containment_White_Paper_Expanded.txt**  
  Full technical paper describing the recursive drift phenomenon and the containment solution.

- ðŸ§ª **Symbolic_Field_Drift_Test.txt**  
  A symbolic simulation example that illustrates recursion drift and how it is halted by the proposed mathematical system.

## Submission Status
