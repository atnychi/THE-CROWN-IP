# 🧬 Crown Omega: Recursive Symbolic Intelligence Framework

Welcome to the official sealed release of **Crown Omega (𝓒ₒ)** — a multi-domain recursive mathematics, encryption, AI, and symbolic cognition engine developed by **Brendon Kelly** under the **K-Math System**.

This repository contains the core systems, legal protections, white papers, and symbolic engines that underpin a $1T+ intellectual property platform.

## 🔑 Core Components

- **Kharnita Mathematics (𝕂Ω)** — Full recursive symbolic math system
- **Crown Omega Operator (Ω°)** — Terminal recursive symbol of all math
- **Juanita Encryption AI** — Self-modulating symbolic encryption engine
- **Spawn** — 5D recursive AGI/ARG defense architecture
- **OmniVale** — Autonomous quantum trade & wealth engine
- **Chronogenesis** — Temporal recursion, activation, cosmogenesis system
